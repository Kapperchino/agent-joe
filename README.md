# Agent Joe

An open source TUI-based coding tool that only works with rust and does not have access to the shell.

## Why

I just hate the fact that cli tools with connections to llm providers can execute any arbitrary command on my terminal.

With the rust only requirement, I can also reduce the number of possible actions to just rust specific ones, lowering
the total tool count.

And this is a fun project to work on.

## State

The runtime milestones through M9 include sessions, bounded workers, guarded
change review, plan mode, tracked steps, and structured user questions. Skills
and controlled MCP integrations remain planned.

## Supported llm providers

| Provider   | Support                                                |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| OpenAI     | Fully supported                                        |
| Codex      | Fully supported                                        |
| Claude     | Should work, haven't tested it in a minute due to cost |
| OpenRouter | Does not support web_search but everything should work |
| Local      | Response api fully supported                           |

## Build & Run

```sh
cargo run --relase
```

## Keybindings

The TUI is similar to claude code and codex with one major difference. Vim bindings are foced upon you.
